# Valour.JS
An unofficial JS wrapper for Valour

## What?
Valour.JS is a wrapper for Valour, that allows you to create bots with script easily. It uses a very similar system to [Valour VAPP](https://github.com/SentyFunBall/valour-vapp)

Note that all focus from Senty is going into VAPP's Nautilus, and not Valour.JS. This will be updated after Nautilus v0.7 is released.
